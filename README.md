# Credit-Risk-Model

During summer 2018, I did some research in credit risk model.

I first realized the methodology in the paper 'Multiperiod Corporate Default Prediction - A Forward Intensity Approach' in python, including the parameter estimation of likelihood function, calculation of Jacobian and Hessian's matrix and analyzed the performance of result based on ROC curve.
